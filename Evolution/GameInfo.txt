Start off as an atom.

clicker to grow atom into a group of atoms.

upgrade to start creating molecules.

upgrade to create water H2O, salt NaCl.

upgrades to create amino acids (9 Atoms), proteins (30 amino acids), Carbohydrates (24 Atoms).

Cytoplasm
a jelly-like fluid (5 Salt and 20 water)

Plasma membrane (10 Proteins 10 Molecules)
The plasma membrane is the outer lining of the cell. 
It separates the cell from its environment and allows materials to enter and leave the cell.

Cytoskeleton (20 Proteins)
a network of long fibers that make up the cell's structural framework. 
The cytoskeleton has several critical functions, including determining cell shape, participating in cell division, 
and allowing cells to move. 

Ribosomes (20 Proteins 10 Amino Acids)
Ribosomes are organelles that process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins. 
These organelles can float freely in the cytoplasm or be connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (see above).

Branch!!!!!!

A
Nucleus (20 DNA 20 Proteins) (Eukaryota)
The nucleus serves as the cell's command center, sending directions to the cell to grow, mature, divide, or die. 
It also houses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cell's hereditary material.

Mitochondria (30 Proteins) (Eukaryota) (Start Creating Proteins)
complex organelles that convert energy from food into a form that the cell can use. 
They have their own genetic material, separate from the DNA in the nucleus, and can make copies of themselves.


B
Nucleoid (20 DNA 20 Proteins) (Bacteria and Archaea) (Start Creating Proteins)
The nucleus serves as the cell's command center, sending directions to the cell to grow, mature, divide, or die. 
It also houses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cell's hereditary material.

Branch!!!!!!

A
Peptidoglycans in the Cell wall (Bacteria)
For example, all bacteria contain peptidoglycans (a molecule composed of both protein and sugar rings) in their 
cell walls. However, archaea do not have this compound in their cell walls.

B
no peptidoglycans in the Cell wall (Bacteria)
